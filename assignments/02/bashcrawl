Welcome to bashcrawl!
=====================

This is a game to teach you the basics of using a POSIX (Linux, BSD,
UNIX) terminal, like the one where you are reading this message now.

Your first move is very important.
Type this into the terminal, and press RETURN:

    cat scroll

You are now playing the game.
May the gods save you.

~/entrance$ cat stroll
cat: stroll: No such file or directory
~/entrance$ cat scroll

It is pitch black in these catacombs.
You have a magickal spell that lists all items in a room.

To see in the dark, type:     ls
To move around, type:         cd <directory>

Try looking around this room.
Then move into one of the next rooms.

EXAMPLE:

$ ls 
$ cd cellar

Remember to cast ``ls`` when you get into the next room!

~/entrance$ ls
cellar  scroll
~/entrance$ cd cellar
~/entrance/cellar$ ls
armoury  scroll  treasure
~/entrance/cellar$ cd armoury
~/entrance/cellar/armoury$ ls
chamber  potion  scroll  treasure
~/entrance/cellar/armoury$ cd chamber
~/entrance/cellar/armoury/chamber$ ls

bash: ./scroll: Permission denied
~/entrance/cellar/armoury/chamber$ ./statue
A rugged statue stands in the corner of the room.

Do you approach it? y/n  y
The statue springs to life, rumbling:

WHO DARES INTRUDE UPON THE CHAMBER OF SPIRITS?

It thrusts a fist at you, hitting you for 5 damage.

You have been slain by the statue.

GAME OVER!
